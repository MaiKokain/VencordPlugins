### Just my custom [Vencord](https://github.com/vendicated/vencord) plugins that is probably only for my use case.
To install just download the plugin file, if you need a guide on how to install custom plugins follow [megu's plugin guide](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/86e94343cca10b950f2dc8d18d496d6db9f3b728/docs/2_PLUGINS.md)

##### [ListenTo](ListenTo/index.ts)
Basically Spotify activity but not Spotify activity, just make your activity display as "Listening to {insert artist name}". Due to the way Discord check if it is Spotify activity, it is not possible to make it display like Spotify activity.

Current issues
- Timestamps not displaying on desktop but does on mobile
